# KDebug

KDebug is a mod for the [Kakara](https://kakara.org/) video game. Kakara is an open source voxel game which can be found in the [kakaragame](https://github.com/kakaragame) organization on github.  
  
This mod is mainly meant to be used for debugging the game during development, but can be
used for other things too. It is important to note that this mod hooks into more than the main
mod API for Kakara and may not serve as the best example for mod creation.
